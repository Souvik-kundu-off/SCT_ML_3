# Customer Classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

This project was completed as part of my internship at **SkillCraft Technology**.  
The objective of this task was to implement a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model to classify customers based on their data.

## 📌 Project Overview

Classification is a core machine learning task that helps businesses categorize customers for better decision-making.  
In this project, I implemented an **SVM model** to predict and classify customer categories using a given dataset.

## 📂 Project Structure


## ⚙️ Steps Performed

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Loaded and cleaned the dataset
   - Checked for missing values
   - Encoded categorical variables (if any)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized feature distributions
   - Analyzed correlations between features

3. **Model Training**
   - Split data into training and testing sets
   - Trained the **SVM classifier**
   - Tuned hyperparameters (kernel, C, gamma)

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Calculated accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
   - Displayed confusion matrix and classification report

5. **Visualization**
   - Plotted decision boundaries (if applicable)
   - Showed classification results

## 📈 Results

- The **SVM model** achieved strong accuracy in classifying customers.
- Results showed clear decision boundaries between classes.
