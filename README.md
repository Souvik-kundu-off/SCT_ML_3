# Cats vs Dogs Classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

This project was completed as part of my internship at **SkillCraft Technology**.  
The objective of this task was to implement a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model to classify images of cats and dogs using the **Kaggle Cats vs Dogs dataset**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision.  
In this project, I used an **SVM classifier** to distinguish between images of cats and dogs.  
The dataset was preprocessed into numerical features suitable for machine learning.

## ⚙️ Steps Performed

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Loaded the Kaggle Cats vs Dogs dataset  
   - Resized and converted images to grayscale  
   - Flattened images into feature vectors  
   - Created training and testing sets  

2. **Model Training**
   - Applied **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** with different kernels  
   - Tuned hyperparameters for better performance  

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluated accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
   - Plotted confusion matrix  

4. **Visualization**
   - Displayed sample predictions for cats and dogs
